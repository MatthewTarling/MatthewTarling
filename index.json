Participating in building the device can also introduce concepts in physics and electromagnetism relating to polarised light microscopy.\nHow the thin section viewer works The thin section viewer consists of two crossed linear polarising filters that rotate together relate to the thin section inserted within.\nIt works on the same sets of principles as cross-polarised light microscopy. The polarising films alter the properties of the light, only allowing certain orientation of the waves that make up light to pass. In the thin section viewer, the two polarising filters are crossed in such a way that ALL light is blocked, this is why when there is no thin section inserted the viewer is dark. When you insert a thin section, the waves of light become altered by the passage through the thin slice of rock, creating new colours which depend on the orientation of the minerals relative to the polarisers. This is why the colours change as you rotate the polarisers.\nFor more detail on how microscopy of rocks and minerals works, check out these fantastic videos by GEO GIRL.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"223958773fdcdb0e861d8d915e01b327","permalink":"https://matthewtarling.github.io/outreach/working/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/working/","section":"outreach","summary":"On this page you will find details on how participating in Viewing the Rock World project works, how the slide viewer works, and resources on how polarised light microscopy works.","tags":null,"title":"How it all works","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"All the components for the thin section viewer can easily be printed on an entry level 3D printer.
